# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tyler

I'm a Site Reliability Engineer who enjoys making complex systems a little less chaotic. I work across the stackâ€”from microcontrollers and automation scripts to old-school hardware like the Commodore 64. I build things, break them, and (usually) put them back together.

This is where I share projects, experiments, and ideas as I go.

> **Note:** [@twl0ng](https://github.com/twl0ng) is my professional account with private contributions. This account (`@ty10ng`) is my public-facing space for open-source projects and personal work, helping me maintain a clear work/life boundary.

## Interests
- **Cybersecurity**: I have a deep fascination for the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity. I continuously explore techniques and strategies to enhance system security, protect sensitive data, and stay ahead of potential threats.
- **Generative AI & LLM Research**: Exploring language models, prompt engineering, and agent-based system design.
- **Automation**: Automation is a cornerstone of my work. I actively seek opportunities to automate tasks, optimize workflows, and increase overall efficiency, regardless of the platform or system involved.
- **Open Source Advocacy**: I strongly believe in the power of open source software and actively support the FOSS methodology. I enjoy utilizing and hope to contribute to open source projects, fostering collaboration and innovation within the community.
