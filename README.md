# üëã Hi, I'm Tyler

I'm a Site Reliability Engineer who enjoys making complex systems a little less chaotic. I work across the stack‚Äîfrom microcontrollers and automation scripts to old-school hardware like the Commodore 64. I build things, break them, and (usually) put them back together.

This is where I share projects, experiments, and ideas as I go.

> **Note:** [@twl0ng](https://github.com/twl0ng) is my professional account with private contributions. This account (`@ty10ng`) is my public-facing space for open-source projects and personal work, helping me maintain a clear work/life boundary.

## Interests

- **Cybersecurity**: Exploring techniques to strengthen system security, protect data, and stay ahead of evolving threats.
- **Generative AI & LLM Research**: Working with language models, prompt engineering, and agent-based system design.
- **Automation**: I look for every opportunity to automate, optimize, and simplify systems across platforms.
- **Open Source Advocacy**: I support FOSS, contribute when I can, and believe in collaborative, transparent software development.

## Projects (WIP)

I‚Äôll curate featured projects here soon. Until then, explore the repos‚ÄîI like to build in the open.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python, C, C++, *Rust (learning)*
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: AWS (Certified SysOps Admin), Azure, DigitalOcean, Linode
- **Containers & Virtualization**: Docker, KVM/QEMU, Libvirt, oVirt, OLVM, VMware ESXi
- **Infra as Code & Automation**: Ansible, Puppet, Terraform
- **CI/CD & DevOps**: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, Thanos
- **Artifact Management**: JFrog Artifactory
- **Operating Systems**: Linux (RHEL, AlmaLinux, Rocky, Oracle Linux, Ubuntu)
- **LLM & Agent Research**: OpenRouter, LM Studio, Ollama (local inference), prompt engineering
- **Embedded & Edge Systems**: Microcontrollers, retro hardware, Commodore 64

## üì¨ Get in Touch

If you're interested in SRE, cybersecurity, automation, virtualization, open source, Linux, or retro tech like the Commodore 64‚ÄîI'd love to connect.
