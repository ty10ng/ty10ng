# 👋 Hi, I'm Tyler

I'm a Site Reliability Engineer who enjoys making complex systems a little less chaotic. I work across the stack—from microcontrollers and automation scripts to old-school hardware like the Commodore 64. I build things, break them, and (usually) put them back together.

This is where I share projects, experiments, and ideas as I go.

> **Note:** [@twl0ng](https://github.com/twl0ng) is my professional account with private contributions. This account (`@ty10ng`) is my public-facing space for open-source projects and personal work, helping me maintain a clear work/life boundary.

## 🧠 Interests

- **Cybersecurity**: Exploring systems hardening, threat modeling, and automation-driven defense techniques.  
- **Generative AI & LLM Research**: Working with language models, agent frameworks, and prompt optimization.  
- **Automation & Infrastructure**: Streamlining workflows through code—from CI/CD pipelines to full system provisioning.  
- **Open Source Advocacy**: Supporting FOSS tools and contributing to transparent, community-driven development.  
- **Embedded Systems & Microcontrollers**: Building and programming low-level systems for automation, prototyping, and hardware hacking.  
- **3D Printing & Digital Fabrication**: Designing and printing custom parts with FDM printers (Prusa MK3S, Ender Pro series) for hardware integration and functional prototyping.

> I enjoy working at the intersection of software, hardware, and physical fabrication—where code meets circuits, and ideas become things.


## Projects (WIP)

I’ll curate featured projects here soon. Until then, explore the repos—I like to build in the open.
